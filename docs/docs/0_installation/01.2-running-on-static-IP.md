Follow these steps to run the engine on a static IP instead of localhost. In most cases you should be able to simply access the engine using the public IP assigned to your device, but if you run into any issues or if you are running the stack on WSL2 then you can refer to the following directions.

### Running on Static IP under WSL2

1. Replace all localhost values with the static IP you want to run the stack on in your .env.local file.
2. Open a powershell terminal as admin. And run the wsl2-port-forwarding.ps1 script present under /scripts directory. 
Note: Make sure all of the required ports are present in ports array of the wsl2-port-forwarding.ps1 script.
3. And now just run the engine as you normally would and everything should be accessible over the static IP.
4. If you get any errors related to localhsot:8642, then make sure that none of the assets in your scene have been saved localhost path. If there are then replace localhost with the static IP in the respective asset's path too.
