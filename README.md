We ([Ethereal Engine](https://github.com/etherealengine)) believe that the Metaverse, 
Web AR, VR, and XR should be easy.

We want a Star Trek future where participating in immersive communication 
technology and shared simulations should be as easy and natural as making a website.

## Project API

### [Library of EE Projects](https://github.com/EtherealEngine/project-manifest)

Create composable plug-ins for Ethereal Engine experiences with the Projects API

### [Create your own projects](https://etherealengine.github.io/etherealengine-docs/docs/manual/creator/project/intro)

## Launch Ethereal Engine with Control Center Install - ***RECOMMENDED***

### [Use Metaverse Control Plane Managment GUI](https://github.com/etherealengine/etherealengine-Control-Center)

Best for simple self hosting, advanced editor content creation, and XRProject Pack Project development.

## Advanced Development Install

### Pre-Requisites

To install Ethereal Engine locally, the following pre-reqs are required.

* Linux (many of us develop on Ubuntu), Mac OS X, or Windows (we recommend WSL2)
* Node.js v16 or later (we recommend installing via [`nvm`](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm)
  or [`asdf`](https://github.com/asdf-vm/asdf).)
* C++ (for `node-gyp`), Python >=3.6 + [PIP](https://pypi.org/project/pip/), `make`
  and other build tools, for compiling Mediasoup.
  Although most of Ethereal Engine is written in TypeScript, it uses a [Mediasoup](https://mediasoup.org/)
  engine for WebRTC conferencing. See the [Mediasoup install instructions](https://mediasoup.org/documentation/v3/mediasoup/installation/)
  for more details.
* Docker. (Although Docker is technically optional, running Ethereal Engine requires starting up
  half a dozen different services, and using Docker Compose will make your life dramatically
  easier.)
* MariaDB and Redis. (If you're using Docker, containers for MariaDB and Redis 
  will automatically be started up.)

### Getting Started

See the [Installation instructions](https://etherealengine.github.io/etherealengine-docs/docs/manual/host/installation/intro)
for more details.

### Let's build it together

We believe that projects like this are extremely complex and difficult, and can 
only be built when large groups of people work together, out in the open. If you 
believe that your calling is to build a free, open network that everyone, 
everywhere can get value from, then you are welcome in our community, and we'll 
do our best to get you set up.

We are always hiring talented people who want to be leaders in what is to come. 
Inquire with anyone who seems like they know what's going on and they'll help 
you find who you need to talk to.
